# Design Thinking Context — Hoosier Hub

This directory captures empathy research and ideation outcomes specific to Hoosier Hub (Indiana University’s resource scheduling platform). Use these artifacts when explaining design decisions or grounding new feature requests.

## Contents
- **personas.md** — Primary IU personas (student entrepreneur, staff lab steward, campus operations analyst)
- **journey_maps.md** — End-to-end flows for student booking, staff approvals, and admin triage

## How to Use
- **Product discussions**: Reference personas to validate whether a feature helps Maya, Dr. Iyer, or Marcus.
- **Design reviews**: Use the journey maps to show how a feature slots into the current flow (e.g., slot picker, owner inbox, admin dashboards).
- **Developer onboarding**: Point new engineers here so they understand the IU context beyond JIRA tickets.

All artifacts should remain IU-specific; avoid generic campus booking examples so reviewers know this work is original to Hoosier Hub.
