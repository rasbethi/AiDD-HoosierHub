# Product Management Context — Hoosier Hub

This folder captures the strategy artifacts that keep Hoosier Hub aligned with the IU stakeholders who actually use the platform (students, staff owners, campus operations).

## Contents
- **okrs.md** — Current Objectives & Key Results for the web app (unified booking experience, owner/admin empowerment, AI concierge adoption, quality gates). Updated whenever goals or scope change.

If we add stakeholder maps, prioritization matrices, or PRDs in the future, they’ll live here. For now the OKRs are the single source of truth for what “success” means in this capstone project.
